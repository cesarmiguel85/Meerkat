# Meerkat
Hybrid mobile prototype for pothole detection and declaration.
Usecase for truck drivers in developping countries with full spoken / hands-free interface.

The phone will detect a pothole with the accelerometer sensor (a sudden shake) and prompt the user what that was.
The driver can then say out loud what happened and declare incidents on the road.
